/*
 * GSF Specifications version 0.02
 *
 * GSF is a PSF format for the GBA. The header of the file should begin with 'PSF' with a version byte
 * of 0x22. Next comes the Reserved section size, Program Section Size, and the Program CRC.
 *
 * The Reserved section is reserved for the possible future use of storing a save state. You may not
 * delete/disregard this section.  The format of how the save state is stored has yet to be defined,
 * as there hasn't been an instance where a save state is needed.
 *
 * The program section contains a GBA rom, that has been patched to only play back music.  If the rip
 * quality is good, then no graphics or any other such things should be in the VRAM/OAM/Pallete Ram.
 * It is layed out in the program section as follows
 *
 * Offset         Size    Description
 * 0x0000000      4       GSF_Entry_Point
 * 0x0000004      4       GSF_Offset
 * 0x0000008      4       Size of Rom.
 * 0x000000C      XX      The Rom data itself.
 *
 * The valid GSF_Entry_Points are 0x2000000 (Multiboot region), and 0x8000000 (Rom region).
 * The The High byte of the Offset should match the high byte of Entry_Point.
 *
 * The offset/size helps you to know how much rom space to allocate, but is also used for
 * minigsf/gsflibs.  Look at the official psf specs for lib loading order.  Multiple libs are
 * now supported.
 *
 * Finally, Look at the official psf specs for info on how tags are stored.
